Welcome to inbetween!
Some quick pointers on how the game works:
- Beware of lava, it will hurt you, and possibly kill you
- pressing "i" will open up your inventory
- Clicking on items in inventory will activate them
- Potions can be drunk, alcohol has not yet been filled on the bottles and is therefore useless
- Beware of (not yet finished) fighting, whne insulting angry people!
